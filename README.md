Last Updated: October 2025
Version: 1.0
Introduction
BlazeMate values your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy
Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share information when you use the BlazeMate mobile
application (“App”). By using BlazeMate, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If
you do not agree, please do not use the App.
1. Information We Collect
When you use BlazeMate, we may collect information you provide (such as username, email, profile
photo, and optional bio), and limited technical data like device information, app usage, and approximate
location (city-level only). BlazeMate never collects precise GPS coordinates or sensitive data such as
financial, biometric, or health information.
2. How We Use Your Information
We use your data to provide and maintain the BlazeMate App, enable friends-only sharing of Moments,
improve user experience, respond to support requests, and ensure app safety and compliance.
BlazeMate never sells personal data.
3. How We Share Information
BlazeMate is a private, friends-only social app. Information is shared only with mutual friends, essential
service providers (such as Firebase, Cloudinary, or Supabase), or as required by law. We do not share
user data for advertising or unrelated analytics.
4. Data Storage and Security
Data is securely stored using encrypted cloud infrastructure and HTTPS communication. BlazeMate
uses token-based authentication and industry-standard safeguards against unauthorized access or
misuse.
5. Your Privacy Controls
Users can edit or delete their Moments, remove friends, and adjust privacy settings (friends-only by
default). Account deletion requests can be sent to privacy@blazemateapp.com, and all associated data
will be permanently removed within a reasonable timeframe.
6. Cookies and Tracking
BlazeMate does not use cookies or third-party trackers for advertising. Anonymous analytics may be
used to improve performance.
7. Age and Legal Use
BlazeMate is intended for users aged 18+ (or the minimum legal age in their region). Users must
comply with local laws. BlazeMate does not facilitate, promote, or sell cannabis or any illegal
substances.
8. International Users
User data may be processed in regions where BlazeMate’s servers or service providers are located, in
compliance with relevant data protection laws.
9. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this policy periodically. Users will be notified of significant changes via in-app notice or
email. The latest version will always be available at www.blazemateapp.com/privacy-policy.
